# Java Full Stack Developer Journey üå±

Welcome to my **Java Full Stack Developer** journey! I'm documenting my progress as I learn Java from scratch and work my way through various programming challenges and concepts. This repository serves as a portfolio of my learning path, showcasing all the coding practices, projects, and challenges that I tackle along the way.  

## üìÖ **Day 3 - Java Basics** üñ•Ô∏è

### **What I Learned:**

- **Data Types**:
  - Explored **primitive** data types (int, float, double, boolean, char) and **non-primitive** types (String, Arrays).
  - Learned how different data types affect memory usage and program performance.

- **User Input**:
  - Implemented the **Scanner class** to capture dynamic input from the user.
  - Took input for different data types (strings, integers) and used them for calculations and string manipulations.

- **Escape Sequences**:
  - Used escape sequences (e.g., `\n`, `\t`) for formatting output and making it visually cleaner and more readable.
  - Printed patterns and formatted user-friendly messages.

- **Pattern Printing**:
  - Printed various patterns (e.g., increasing and decreasing triangles) using loops and escape sequences.

### **Completed Challenges:**

1. **Challenge 4: Pattern Printing**  
   - Printed patterns using `*` in different shapes (triangles, pyramids) with escape sequences.
   - Example: 
     ```java
     System.out.println("*\n**\n***\n****\n*****");
     ```

2. **Challenge 5: Dynamic String Insertion**  
   - Built a program that dynamically inserted user input into a string.  
   - Example:  
     ```java
     System.out.println("Welcome " + name + " to IntelliJ");
     ```

3. **Challenge 6: Addition of Two Numbers**  
   - Took two numbers as input and printed their sum.  
   - Example:  
     ```java
     System.out.println("Sum of your Numbers is: " + sum);
     ```
## Takeaways from Day 3:
- Mastered Data Types: Grasped the fundamentals of Java data types, including primitive and non-primitive types.
- Enhanced User Interaction: Gained experience using Scanner for user input, and effectively used string concatenation for dynamic output.
- Improved Logic Building: Learned how to use loops and escape sequences to solve pattern printing challenges.
- Hands-on with Java Syntax: Reinforced core syntax and coding practices that will help with future projects and problem-solving.
